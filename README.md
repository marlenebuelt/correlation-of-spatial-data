# correlation-of-spatial-data

## Dataset
Tried to summarize null-values here. Will possibly be deleted soon.

## DropMunics
Determines which municipalities we drop and merges them to a large file. Might be extended to changing the dataset so we have it all in one place
The merge part might be deleted soon as we cant use it.

## MissingDatesPerLocation
Missing totals per location

## MissingDates
returns how many municipalities didn't enter values on a specific date

## MissingCumulativesByLocation
Cumulative sums of missing weeks

## SpatialCorrelation_CombinedMap
will possibly be deleted as plotting two scenarios in one map does not work out.

## SpatialCorrelation
plots all locations and all deleted locations on a map
